# Aircraft-Routing

Abstract
Over the past few decades, the airline industry has evolved into a sophisticated business, with conventional objectives such as operational efficiency, effective fleet assignment, flight punctuality, and equitable crew scheduling being the primary focus. Nevertheless, given the growing accessibility to customer feedback (either through public forums or private data), it is crucial to make business decisions that cater to the customers' requirements in addition to conventional goals. Within aircraft operations, there is a series of decisions to be made, such as flight scheduling, fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew scheduling. After designating a fleet type to each flight leg, airlines ascertain the sequence of flight legs, or strings, to be operated by individual aircrafts, while complying with obligatory maintenance checks. This constitutes the aircraft routing problem.

We introduce a novel approach to a particular version of aircraft routing problem, namely flight leg sequence scheduling, infusing traditional scheduling methodologies with insightful customer feedback to forge a more responsive and customer-centric operational model. Traditional flight sequence scheduling methodologies typically concentrate on minimizing propagated delay. However, by integrating customer feedback to inform scheduling decisions, more effective prioritization of flight legs can be achieved. We propose an optimization model that strives to minimize propagated delay while prioritizing flights based on customer feedback, thus resulting in customer-aware flight leg sequence schedules. To solve the proposed optimization model, we propose an alternating optimization scheme where feasible flight leg sequences are selected from the pool of available flight leg sequences using a string generation procedure, followed by  solving an integer linear optimization problem over only the feasible set of flight leg sequences. To construct feasible strings of flights at each iteration, we use two different methods. The first method is based on a dynamic programming approach which is useful for deterministic delay information. To handle practical cases where delays are uncertain, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to construct the strings. We provide experiments of our proposed methods on synthetic and real data sets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL model in comparison to dynamic programming based model.
